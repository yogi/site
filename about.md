My name is Yogi Kulkarni. I am 41 years old, I have 2 little girls
 and an amazing wife who is graciously supporting me in my Fab Academy adventure (which requires me
 to be away from home for weeks at a time).

I am a software engineer and have been building software for [a long time][LinkedIn Profile]. Most
recently I helped build the supply-chain system and the internal cloud platform for 
[India's largest e-commerce company][Flipkart].

Fab Academy to me is about mashing-up hardware, software and art. 

I also love the idea of moving from being a passive consumer of mass-produced goods to being a creator of personal products 
matched closely to my needs and the needs of those around me.

As far as interests go, I'm likely to jump into any conversation related to
football, books, movies or TV shows. You  might be able to guess some of my
favorites from these lines:

* "That there are places [in][ShawshankRedemption] the world that aren't made out of stone. That
  there's... there's somethin' inside that they can't get to; that they can't
  touch. It's yours."

* When you [walk][LFC] through a storm, hold your head up high   
   And don't be afraid of the dark   
   At the end of the storm, there's a golden sky   
   And the sweet, silver song of a lark

* "It really stemmed from when I was in college and trying to think: what would
  affect the future most likely in [a][ElonMusk] positive way"

* "So [if][GoodWillHunting] I asked you about art, you’d probably give me the skinny on every art
  book ever written. Michelangelo, you know a lot about him. Life’s work,
  political aspirations, him and the pope, sexual orientations, the whole works,
  right? But I’ll bet you can’t tell me what it smells like in the Sistine
  Chapel. You’ve never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful
  ceiling; seen that."

* "I find your lack [of][StarWars] faith disturbing."

* "These pretzels are making [me][Seinfeld] thirsty"

* दिलों में तुम अपनी बेताबियाँ लेके चल रहे हो, तो ज़िंदा [हो][Zindagi] तुम  
  नज़र में ख्वाबों की बिजलियाँ लेके चल रहे हो, तो ज़िंदा हो तुम

* "First they ignore you, then they laugh [at][Gandhi] you, then they fight you, then you
  win."
  
* The minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something
  will, you know [if][Jobs] you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you
  can change it, you can mold it. That’s maybe the most important thing. It’s to
  shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you’re just gonna live in
  it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.
