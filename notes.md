## Todos

* Video  
* Audio
* Explore Processing 
* Site design hints from here: http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.13/people/nitsky/. Home page is well spaced, with a short note and a single image.

## Notes
* Using layers of plywood and acrylic for a device thats similar to HiTime: http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/sa/students/sierra.luis/final-proyect.html
One more example: http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/as/students/okazaki.asako/work18.html

3D Printing projects:
* iPhone cover
* Curved lantern, lampshade
* Make something that moves something e.g. top with prongs which rise when spinning.
* Interlocking parts
* Davinci machine
* Gyroscope?

## Final project ideas

Capsense Piano: http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.13/people/nitsky/week11.html
Something with PID control
Some electronic device with retro look - fab boombox, clock


What are the key learnings and the hardest things to do for each week? Focus on those:
For CNC: cutting, engraving, dual side cuts - like the propeller, angular cuts
    - joinery
    - rest is largely design complexity - so master Rhino + Grasshopper
    
    
Computational, algorithmic design and art is amazing! George Hart's work in particular.
