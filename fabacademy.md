Fab Academy is an intensive [20 week course][Schedule] in digital fabrication.

It has its roots in MIT's course on [How to make (almost) anything][HTMAA], which
was started by [Prof. Neil Gershenfeld][ProfNeil] at MIT's [Center for Bits and
Atoms][CBA].

To know more about the idea and vision for digital fabrication, here's a great 
talk about "The Third Digital Revolution" given by Neil at SolidCon.

Here is an [Edge.org interview][EdgeInterview], which goes into details about the background and motivation for personal fabrication.

And a book that he wrote - ["Fab: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop"][FabBook].

This year more than 300 students are attending Fab Academy in [70 Fab Labs][FabLabs] all over the world, including 3 
locations in India (Trivandrum, Kochi & Pune).

The course covers [topics][Schedule] from CAD, computer-controlled
cutting, 3D printing, electronics & embedded systems, mechanical & machine
design, molding & casting, etc.

At the end of the course students have to build a project which brings together many, if not all, the 
skills they've learnt. 

Here is a list of the incredible [projects made by last year's students][2015Projects].
