# 25th Feb

Recording of the Hangout is here: https://plus.google.com/events/csn823k03v0a6hm1nns456p6c4g


* Neil is maintaining a wall of shame for those whose site wasn't updated and didn't speak up during the review. Kerala had 3 out of 7 in that list :-(



## 3D Printing

* Thingiverse - group assignment - find out limits of the machine

   Search for "test": http://www.thingiverse.com/search/page:1?q=test&sa=, chose 1 and do as a group
   e.g. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:704409

*   [Ultimaker Visual Troubleshooting Guide](http://support.3dverkstan.se/article/23-a-visual-ultimaker-troubleshooting-guide) - check
    for under-extrusion. Familiarize yourself with common problems.

* "Leveling" is critical

* Its important to design specifically for the machine and its limitations. Things to take care of - overhangs, angle of edges, support material


## 3D Scanning

* Structured Light

* XBox Kinect

* Camera

* Roland Modela (try something small, or glass)

Optionally try to make your own scanner (milk scanner, laser scanner)
